<p>Builder design pattern is a most often used software design pattern. Please refer to the overview of design patterns <a href="http://vwtt.github.io/blog/design-patterns-overview" target="_blank">here</a>. The intent of Builder pattern is separating object construction and its represenation. Here builder knows how to build a complex object and we also need a Director class, essentially a helper class which know what to build. Director uses Builder class (one or more builder classes) and helps in building the complex object.</p>
